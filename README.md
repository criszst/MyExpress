# MyExpress
A simple express that I made for fun. It's really not completely, but i pretend to added new features on future

### CHECKLIST:
- [x] __Normal APP, with send, post and also res, req and next methods__
- [x] Recreate the "merge-descriptors" lib, just for no dependency of the lib. Btw, this is more security
- [ ] Some interfaces to clean up all the code (at this point i only add one interface)
- [ ] Add more middlewares
- [ ] Add tests


### INSTALL

First, clone the repository with git:

```
git clone https://github.com/criszst/MyExpress.git
```

Open the directory
```
cd MyExpress
```

Then, install all packages of npm:

```
npm install

```
If do you want run all the tests... (this is not necessary for run the project, its just a good practice):

```
npm run tests

So, create a dist folder bc node can't read typescript files directly:
```
npm run build
```

After alll that, run the minimal express :)
```
npm run start
```
