# MyExpress
A simple express that I made for fun. It's really not completely, but i pretend to added new features on future

### CHECKLIST:
- [x] __Normal APP, with send, post and also res, req and next methods__
- [ ] Some interfaces to clean up all the code (at this point i only add one interface)
- [ ] Add more middlewares 
- [ ] Recreate the "merge-descriptors" lib, just for no dependency of the lib. Btw, this is more security
